Alternatives to the \nanterior approach are lateral access techniques through the individual’s side (XLIF, DLIF, OLIF).

CMS established the \nAcute Hospital Care at Home waiver program during the Public Health Emergency as a way for experienced hospitals to divert \nMedicare patients to home setting in order to deal with high demand and capacity issues for inpatient beds.   \n \nTo be admitted to the Acute Hospital Care at Home program, a member must meet specific inpatient admission criteria and \nscreened per protocol of attending practitioner at a designated facility contracted to provide the service. A member must live \nwithin 30 miles of a Home Hospitalization provider in order to enroll in Acute Hospital Care at Home determined by attending \npractitioner. Care will be provided and coordinated by the hospitals Acute Hospital Care at Home team. \n \nNew coding for home hospitalization has been established by the National Uniform Billing Committee. (Revenue code 0161 and \noccurrence span code 82, and dates). \n \nNetwork participating facilities who have the CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home approved waiver, are eligible to become \ndesignated providers.
